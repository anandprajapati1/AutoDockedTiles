# AutoDockedTiles
For front end developers, many times this type of design comes that on a list page view if there are n number of tiles, they should be auto adjusted as per their height. I am going to try some scenarios here.

## Case 1 - Tiles having two fixed size with random occurence
Code has been updated for this. Please see [AutoDockedTiles page](https://anandprajapati1.github.io/AutoDockedTiles/)
